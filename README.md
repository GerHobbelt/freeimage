What is FreeImage ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FreeImage is an Open Source library project for developers who would like to support popular graphics image formats like PNG, BMP, JPEG, TIFF and others as needed by today's multimedia applications.

FreeImage is easy to use, fast, multithreading safe, and cross-platform (works with Windows, Linux and Mac OS X).

### This GitHub Fork/Patch of FreeImage
 - Numerous Sub-Dependancy patches (Security/Bugs/Latest) 
 - With patches applied from nVidia Devs and OpenSource additions
 - CMake Build ability allowing compiling easily for all targets and platforms 

Thanks to it's ANSI C interface, FreeImage is usable in many languages including C, C++, VB, C#, Delphi, Java and also in common scripting languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, TCL, Lua or Ruby.

The library comes in two versions: a binary DLL distribution that can be linked against any WIN32/WIN64 C/C++ compiler and a source distribution.
Workspace files for Microsoft Visual Studio provided, as well as makefiles for Linux, Mac OS X and other systems.

## Original Source Code Upstream

Original library can be found : https://freeimage.sourceforge.io 

## Status

[![CMake build](https://github.com/danoli3/FreeImage/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danoli3/FreeImage/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

## Building this fork

By default, JPEG-XR support is only included on Windows, but not on other platforms.

### Simply build it

```bash
cmake . -B cmake-build
cmake --build cmake-build # On Linux, add -j$(nproc) for multicore build
```

### Build and install Debug and Release configuration

```bash
cmake . -B cmake-build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install_dir
cmake --build cmake-build-debug --config Debug --target install # Linux: -j$(nproc)

cmake . -B cmake-build-release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install_dir
cmake --build cmake-build-release --config Release --target install # Linux: -j$(nproc)
```
Now `install_dir` contains the compiled binaries for debug and release, as well as the header file and the CMake Config files.

## Using compiled binaries

First, build and install it like explained above.

Then, in another project add the following CMake code:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH <freeimage_install_location>)
find_package(FreeImage CONFIG REQUIRED)
...
target_link_libraries(<your_target> PRIVATE FreeImage::FreeImage)
```

For `find_package` to work, simply set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the directory where the compiled binaries are installed (the `install_dir` folder from above).

## Running tests

```bash
cmake . -B cmake-build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build cmake-build-debug --config Debug # Linux: -j$(nproc)
ctest --test-dir cmake-build-debug -C Debug # Optionally --rerun-failed --output-on-failure
```

> This ctest command only works with CMake 3.20 or higher. For earlier versions, you must `cd` into `cmake-build-debug` and call ctest without `--test-dir cmake-build-debug`.

--------

This branch is used to compile the FreeImage.DLL used in Quick Picto Viewer. It brings the following changes:
- FillBackgroundBitmap() has a new optional parameter;
- applied patches/fixes found in the Fedora F39 repository for: CVE-2020-24292, CVE-2020-24293, CVE-2020-24295, CVE-2021-33367, CVE-2021-40263, CVE-2021-40266, CVE-2023-47995, CVE-2023-47997;
-- Patches found at: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/freeimage/tree/f39
-- CVE-2021-40266 - nullptr pointer dereference in ReadPalette() in PluginTIFF.cpp [fedora-all]
-- CVE-2023-47995 - prevents memory allocation with dimensions that exceed the JPEG format limits
-- CVE-2023-47997 - prevent an infinite loop in PluginTIFF.cpp::Load. 
- fixed buffer overflows in PluginICO.cpp, PSDParser.cpp, PluginTIFF.cpp (with the aforementioned patches)
- fixed jxr encoder to be able to handle images over 1300 mgpx;
- fixed bmp decoder/encoder to be able to handle images over 1300 mgpx;
- fixed behavior with extreme values of the tone-mapping algorithms; 
- fixed out of bounds accesses in PluginBMP, PluginPSD, PluginMNG and PluginPICT;
- fixed integer wrap around and segmentation fault in Exif.cpp;
- fixed FreeImage_Copy() to not crash with very large images [over 5000 mgpx];
- fixed FreeImage_Rescale() to work with very large images [over 5000 mgpx]; it no longer screws up the colors;
- fixed FreeImage_Rotate() to work with very large images [over 5000 mgpx];
- multi-threaded image resizer and rotation using OpenMP pragma;
- updated the OpenEXR library to version 3.1.3, from version 2.2.0;
- added FreeImage_RescaleRawBits()

Bugs or limitations identified:
- images over 5000 mgpx saved as JXR might be malformed; only Freeimage opens them correctly; Windows Photo opens them [on Win10], but without an alpha channel; Affinity Photo 2.0 and paint.net v5.0 crash on open;

---------------------

Known issues:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - various CVEs identified and unpatched/fixed
    - buffer overflows in PluginICO.cpp, PSDParser.cpp, PluginTIFF.cpp
    - out of bounds accesses in PluginBMP, PluginPSD, PluginMNG and PluginPICT;
    - integer wrap around and segmentation fault in Exif.cpp;
    - incorrect behavior with extreme values for the tone-mapping algorithms;
    - the jxr encoder cannot handle very large images [eg. >1300 mgpx];
    - the bmp decoder/encoder cannot handle very large images [eg. >1300 mgpx];
    - FreeImage_FlipVertical() does not work correctly with image objects created via FreeImage_CreateView();
    - FreeImage_Copy() crashes with very large images [eg. over 5000 mgpx];
    - FreeImage_Rescale() yields incorrect results for very large images [eg. >4000 mgpx];
    - FreeImage_Rotate() cannot handle very large images [eg. >5000 mgpx];
    - very old OpenEXR library - version 2.2.0;

These issues have been fixed in the QPV branch on this repository.
