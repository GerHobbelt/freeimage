What is FreeImage ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FreeImage is an Open Source library project for developers who would like to support popular graphics image formats like PNG, BMP, JPEG, TIFF and others as needed by today's multimedia applications.

FreeImage is easy to use, fast, multithreading safe, and cross-platform (works with Windows, Linux and Mac OS X).

Thanks to it's ANSI C interface, FreeImage is usable in many languages including C, C++, VB, C#, Delphi, Java and also in common scripting languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, TCL, Lua or Ruby.

The library comes in two versions: a binary DLL distribution that can be linked against any WIN32/WIN64 C/C++ compiler and a source distribution.
Workspace files for Microsoft Visual Studio provided, as well as makefiles for Linux, Mac OS X and other systems.

--------

This branch is used to compile the FreeImage.DLL used in Quick Picto Viewer. It brings the following changes:

- fixed jxr encoder to be able to handle images over 1300 mgpx;
- fixed bmp decoder/encoder to be able to handle images over 1300 mgpx;
- fixed behavior with extreme values of the tone-mapping algorithms; 
- fixed out of bounds read in PluginBMP;
- fixed integer wrap around and segmentation fault in Exif.cpp;
- fixed FreeImage_Copy() to not crash with very large images [over 5000 mgpx];
- fixed FreeImage_Rescale() to work with very large images [over 5000 mgpx]; it no longer screws up the colors;
- fixed FreeImage_Rotate() to work with very large images [over 5000 mgpx];
- multi-threaded image resizer and rotation using OpenMP pragma;
- added FreeImage_RescaleRawBits()

Bugs or limitations identified:
- images saved as JXR seem malformed; only Windows Photo opens them [Win10], but without an alpha channel; Affinity Photo 2.0 and paint.net v5.0 crash on open;
